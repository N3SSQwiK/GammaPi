# Gamma Pi Discord Forum Channel Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0
**Context:** Forum channels are for persistent, topical, and organized discussions. They prevent important information from being lost in the fast-moving chronological feed of standard text channels.

---

## 🏛️ Philosophy: Text vs. Forum

*   **Standard Text Channels (#general, #banter):** Use for real-time, fleeting conversation. If the information is irrelevant in 24 hours, post it here.
*   **Forum Channels:** Use for "Topics of Record." If a brother should be able to find this information two weeks from now, it belongs in a Forum.
