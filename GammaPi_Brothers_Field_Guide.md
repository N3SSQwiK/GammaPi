## 🤝 Phase 2: The Professional Rolodex
Stop shouting "Does anyone know someone in Finance?" into the void. Use the database.

### 🔎 Find a Brother
*   **Command:** `/find`
*   **Usage:** Type `/find` and hit Tab. You can filter by:
    *   `industry`: e.g., "Technology / Software", "Finance / Banking".
    *   `city`: e.g., "New York", "Chicago".
*   **Example:** `/find industry:Marketing` -> *Returns brothers in Marketing.*

**Note:** Brothers with Don Names appear as "Don Phoenix" in search results.

### 🧠 Mentorship (Office Hours)
Willing to chat with younger brothers or candidates? Toggle your status.
*   **Command:** `/mentor status:On`
*   **Result:** You get the `🧠 Open to Mentor` badge on your profile.
*   **Command:** `/mentor status:Off` (When you get too busy).

### 🦁 The Lions' Den (Personal Blogs)
Instead of 50 separate channels, we have **one** Forum called `#lions-den`.
1.  **Create Your Space:** Post a new thread titled *"Nexus's Blog"* or *"John's Gym Log"*.
2.  **Tag It:** Use tags like `🏋️ Fitness` or `🎮 Gaming` so others can find you.
3.  **Post Updates:** Treat this thread like your personal social feed.
4.  **Follow:** Click the "Follow" (Bell) icon on brothers' threads you want to see updates from.

## 📜 Phase 4: Rules of Engagement (Etiquette)

1.  **Respect the Channels:**
    *   `#announcements`: Read-only. Important info lives here.
    *   `#general-chat`: The "Living Room". Banter goes here.
    *   `#sensitive-matters`: strictly confidential. What is posted here, stays here.
2.  **Reply vs. New Message:**
    *   If you are responding to a specific conversation, use the **Reply** function (Right-click -> Reply).
    *   If a conversation gets deep/long, start a **Thread** (Hash icon -> Create Thread) to keep the main chat clean.
3.  **Notifications:**
    *   We rarely use `@everyone`. If you get pinged, it's important.
    *   Please check the **#weekly-digest** email on Fridays for summaries.
