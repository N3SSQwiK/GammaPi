# 🦁 Gamma Pi Digital Hub: Brother's Field Guide

**Welcome, Brother!**
You have entered the new digital headquarters for the Gamma Pi Chapter. This isn't just a group chat; it's a professional tool designed to help us operate efficiently and network powerfully.

This guide will teach you how to use **FiotaBot**, our custom AI assistant, and navigate the server like a pro.

## 🔑 Phase 1: Access & Verification

### 1. The Welcome Gate
When you first join, you will see almost nothing. This is security by design.
1.  Go to the **#welcome-gate** channel.
2.  Click the red **[Brother Verification]** button.
3.  Fill out the form:
    *   **Voucher:** Name an *Active* ΓΠ Brother who can verify you.
    *   **Zip Code:** Used to show your Time Zone/City on your profile.
    *   **Industry/Title:** Critical for the "Rolodex" (see below).
4.  **Wait:** Two brothers must vote to approve you. Once approved, the server will unlock.

## 🤝 Phase 2: The Professional Rolodex
Stop shouting "Does anyone know someone in Finance?" into the void. Use the database.

### 🔎 Find a Brother
*   **Command:** `/find`
*   **Usage:** Type `/find` and hit Tab. You can filter by:
    *   `industry`: e.g., "Tech", "Law", "Finance".
    *   `city`: e.g., "New York", "Chicago".
*   **Example:** `/find industry:Marketing` -> *Returns a list of brothers in Marketing.*

### 🧠 Mentorship (Office Hours)
Willing to chat with younger brothers or candidates? Toggle your status.
*   **Command:** `/mentor status:On`
*   **Result:** You get the `🧠 Open to Mentor` badge on your profile.
*   **Command:** `/mentor status:Off` (When you get too busy).

## 📜 Phase 4: Rules of Engagement (Etiquette)

1.  **Respect the Channels:**
    *   `#announcements`: Read-only. Important info lives here.
    *   `#general-chat`: The "Living Room". Banter goes here.
    *   `#sensitive-matters`: strictly confidential. What is posted here, stays here.
2.  **Reply vs. New Message:**
    *   If you are responding to a specific conversation, use the **Reply** function (Right-click -> Reply).
    *   If a conversation gets deep/long, start a **Thread** (Hash icon -> Create Thread) to keep the main chat clean.
3.  **Notifications:**
    *   We rarely use `@everyone`. If you get pinged, it's important.
    *   Please check the **#weekly-digest** email on Fridays for summaries.
